----The procedure has produced various so called “false-positives”. 
---Meaning that it also identified features to be a car, which in fact are not cars 
---at all. Therefore, some of the “cars” that the algorithm identified are actually 
---air-condition units on a roof or a skate-ramp in the middle of a park. 
---Therefore, before you link the cars to the street sections, you need to 
---filter the footprints of the cars and remove the largest share of false positives 
---(it is impossible to remove all of them). In order to do so we prepared a 
--sub-sample from Alkmaar of the official topographical map for the Netherlands. 
--We preselected a couple of layers which are shown in table 1.

-- Filter out false positive car detections
CREATE TABLE filtered_cars AS
SELECT id, geom, class, confidence
FROM ml_cars2
WHERE class = 'car' AND confidence >= 0.8 AND ST_Intersects(geom, (SELECT ST_Union(geom) FROM bgt_wegdeel22 WHERE function IN ('road', 'parking_area')));

-- Link remaining car features to street sections
CREATE  TABLE car_street_links AS
SELECT c.id AS car_id, s.id AS section_id
FROM filtered_cars c, ecorys_alkmaar_sections2 s
WHERE ST_Intersects(c.geom, s.geom);

-- Join car and street section data for analysis
CREATE  TABLE car_section_data AS
SELECT c.id AS car_id, s.sectie, s.plaats, s.straat, s.sec_length
FROM filtered_cars c
JOIN car_street_links l ON c.id = l.car_id
JOIN ecorys_alkmaar_sections2 s ON l.section_id = s.id;




-- Filter out false positive car detections
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE filtered_cars AS
SELECT id, geom, class, confidence
FROM ml_cars2
WHERE class = 'car' AND confidence >= 0.8 AND ST_Intersects(geom, (SELECT ST_Union(geom) FROM bgt_wegdeel22 WHERE function IN ('road', 'parking_area')));

-- Link remaining car features to street sections
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE car_street_links AS
SELECT c.id AS car_id, s.id AS section_id
FROM filtered_cars c, ecorys_alkmaar_sections2 s
WHERE ST_Intersects(c.geom, s.geom);

-- Join car and street section data for analysis
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE car_section_data AS
SELECT c.id AS car_id, s.sectie, s.plaats, s.straat, s.sec_length, c.geom AS car_geom, s.geom AS section_geom
FROM filtered_cars c
JOIN car_street_links l ON c.id = l.car_id
JOIN ecorys_alkmaar_sections2 s ON l.section_id = s.id;

-- Display car-street section data on a map
SELECT car_id, sectie, plaats, straat, sec_length, ST_AsText(car_geom) AS car_geom, ST_AsText(section_geom) AS section_geom
FROM car_section_data;
---In this updated code, I've added the "car_geom" and "section_geom" columns to the output table, which contain the geometries for the car detections and street sections, respectively. This will allow you to display the data on a map and visualize the results of the analysis.
